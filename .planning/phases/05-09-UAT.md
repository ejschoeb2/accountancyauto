<!-- OVERWRITE each test - shows where we are -->

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Create a New Email Template
expected: Navigate to Templates & Schedules page. Click "New Template" button. You should see a form with: template name input, subject line input with placeholder button, and a rich text editor body with formatting toolbar (bold, italic, lists, links, placeholder insertion).
result: pass

### 2. Insert Placeholder Pills in Body
expected: In the template editor body, type "/" or click the placeholder button in the toolbar. A dropdown should appear with available variables (e.g. Client Name, Deadline Date). Selecting one inserts a styled pill (colored badge showing {{variable}}) that cannot be split or partially deleted - backspace removes the entire pill.
result: pass

### 3. Insert Placeholder in Subject Line
expected: In the subject line area, click the placeholder button. A dropdown appears. Select a variable - it inserts {{variable}} text into the subject. A preview below the input shows the placeholder rendered as a styled pill.
result: pass

### 4. Paste Content Strips Formatting
expected: Copy some formatted text from a Word document or web page (bold, colors, images). Paste it into the template editor body. All formatting should be stripped - only plain text appears. You then re-apply formatting using the toolbar.
result: pass

### 5. Save and View Template in List
expected: Fill in template name, subject, and body content. Click Save. You are redirected to the Templates list page showing a card grid. Your new template appears as a card with: name, active status badge, subject preview, and timestamp.
result: pass

### 6. Edit an Existing Template
expected: From the template card grid, click on a template card. The edit page loads with the template name, subject, and body content pre-populated in the editor (including any placeholder pills). Make a change and save - it persists.
result: pass

### 7. Delete a Template (Not in Use)
expected: On the edit page, click the Delete button. A confirmation dialog appears. Confirm deletion. The template is removed and you're redirected to the list.
result: pass

### 8. Delete a Template (In Use by Schedule)
expected: Try to delete a template that is assigned to a schedule step. You should see a 409 error message saying "Template is in use by a schedule and cannot be deleted."
result: pass

### 9. Templates & Schedules Sub-Tab Navigation
expected: On the Templates & Schedules page, you see two sub-tabs: "Templates" and "Schedules". Clicking between them switches the view. The URL updates with ?tab=schedules or ?tab=templates.
result: pass

### 10. Create a New Schedule
expected: Go to the Schedules tab. Click "New Schedule". You see a form with: schedule name, filing type dropdown, active toggle, and a steps section. Add steps with template dropdown, delay days (preset buttons 7/14/30 + custom), and urgency level (Normal/High/Urgent).
result: issue
reported: "when i click to create schedule i get this error - filingTypes.map is not a function at EditSchedulePage line 215"
severity: blocker

### 11. Reorder Schedule Steps
expected: In the schedule editor with multiple steps, use the up/down arrow buttons on a step card. Steps reorder visually and the order is preserved when saving.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by Test 10 - schedule editor page crashes on load

### 12. Duplicate a Schedule
expected: From the schedule list, click the duplicate action on a schedule. A new schedule appears in the list with "(Copy)" appended to the name and set to inactive.
result: issue
reported: "i get error schedule with this name already exists and it doesn't work"
severity: major

### 13. Ad-Hoc Send Email Flow
expected: On the Clients page, select one or more clients using checkboxes. A bulk actions toolbar appears with a "Send Email" button. Click it. A modal opens with template selection step.
result: pass

### 14. Ad-Hoc Email Preview
expected: In the Send Email modal, select a template. Click Next/Preview. An email preview appears (in an iframe) showing the template rendered with the selected client's data (placeholders replaced with actual values like client name).
result: pass

### 15. Ad-Hoc Email Confirm and Send
expected: After preview, click Confirm/Send. A progress bar shows sending progress as emails are sent one by one. After completion, a results screen shows sent count and any failures.
result: pass

### 16. Delivery Log Shows Ad-Hoc Badge
expected: Navigate to the Delivery Log. Ad-hoc sends appear with an "Ad-hoc" badge/indicator in an accent color. Scheduled sends show as plain text or different styling.
result: pass

### 17. Duplicate Template Warning in Schedule
expected: In the schedule editor, assign the same template to two different steps. A non-blocking warning appears indicating the template is used in multiple steps. It does not prevent saving.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by Test 10 - schedule editor page crashes on load
